import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

Born in 1998, I grew up in the midst of the digital rise. As a teenager I wrote my first program of fibonacci in C language in college and got more and more interested in the programming.

After college, I started to learning how to code and make robust web applications. I was lucky enough to work as developer in international companies where I learned more about testing, web automation, APIs, AWS and many more from talented peoples.

Currently, I am working as lead frontend engineer at CHEQ Inc.
